		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			Sushi rice is less of a type of rice than it is a preparation
			method. It's cooked short-grain white rice combined with rice
			vinegar and other ingredients, cooled completely, and then used to
			make sushi rolls.
		</p>
		<p>
			Classic sushi rice is seasoned with just rice vinegar, white sugar,
			and salt. This recipe calls for vegetable oil instead of a bolder
			oil, so the simple seasonings have a chance to really shine.
		</p>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 cups uncooked glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>
			<li>3 cups water</li>
			<li>½ cup rice vinegar</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
			<li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>

				Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander under cold running
				water until the water runs clear.
			</li>
			<li>
				Combine rice and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat and

				is tender and all water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.

				Meanwhile, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a small
				saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar has dissolved.
				Allow to cool. Then stir into the cooked rice. While mixture
				will appear very wet at first, keep stirring and rice will dry
				as it cools.
